Yet another port of the [ZSH pure prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) to the [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) 🐟. It's not intended to be customizable, basically all values are hard-coded to sensible defaults.

Based on [vkovtash/pure](https://github.com/vkovtash/pure) with some ideas from [rafaelrinaldi/pure](https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/pure) but with a lot of changes.
